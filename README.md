# Cotton Plant Disease Checker

Empowering farmers and researchers to detect cotton plant diseases using state-of-the-art deep learning.

---

## 🚀 Overview
This project leverages modern computer vision and deep learning techniques to identify diseases in cotton plants from images. It provides ready-to-use Jupyter Notebooks, a pre-trained model, and clear instructions for training, evaluation, and deployment.

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- `CottonPD.ipynb` — Main workflow for disease detection
- `CPD_v2.ipynb`, `CPD_v3.ipynb`, `CPDwithPRF1.ipynb` — Experimental and advanced notebooks
- `model_1_03333330.h5` — Pre-trained TensorFlow/Keras model
- `README.md` — Project documentation

## 🛠️ Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Open a notebook** (`.ipynb`) in Jupyter, VS Code, or Google Colab
3. **Install dependencies** (see below)
4. **Run the cells** to explore data, train models, and make predictions

## 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or compatible environment
- TensorFlow ≥ 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- tabulate

Install all dependencies with:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tabulate
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Usage
- Use the notebooks to:
  - Load and preprocess image datasets
  - Train and evaluate deep learning models
  - Visualize results and metrics
  - Predict disease class for new images
- The `.h5` model can be loaded in any Keras/TensorFlow environment for inference or further training.

---

## 📊 Example Results
- Precision, Recall, and F1 scores are reported in the notebooks for each test run.
- Visualizations include training curves and prediction samples.
